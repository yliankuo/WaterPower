        Adds new power generation buildings that use hydropower.
        
        Additions:
        
        Underwater Power Cable:
            Designed to built underwater, as such is unbuildable on land. Cost: 2 Steel.
            
        Water Turbine:
            Designed to generate power from river tiles. Increased power output during
            rain/thunderstorms. Can only be built in deep moving water tiles.
            
        Tidal Plant:
            Designed to generate from the ocean. Power output can be boosted by up to 300%
            from the use of Tidal Turbines (10 max). Can only be built in shallow ocean
            water tiles. Requires Tidal Power research.
            
        Tidal Turbine:
            Boosts the power output of the tidal plant by 20%, boost can be stacked up to
            10 times. Can only be built in ocean tiles. Requires Tidal Power research.
            
        Lighthouse:
            Misc. building that produces light in a large area, only built on ocean tiles.
